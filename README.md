# HTTP Reference

This is a handy little helper that puts HTTP reference at your fingertips, when you're on the CLI, when you need it.

## But why?

Because I can **never** remember what the bloody http status codes mean, or the details of methods, or whatever. It's annoying!

## Why not just wikipedia?

Well it boils down to 2 things:

1. If I use the browser then it means that I have to use the mouse, or a track pad or something.
2. I'm a little bored on a Friday night. There's some rubbish film on. Quite frankly I'm a little bored.
3. If I make it good enough then people will give me stars. This, as everyone knows, is a proxy for love and it will make up for many deficiencies in my life.
4. My attention to detail is incredible. I therefore invite you to sponsor me using the links at the top of the page. :)
